  <h1>About The Electing Women Project</h1>
  <br />
  <p style="text-align: center; padding-left:200px; padding-right:200px">The Electing Women Project is an initiative of Women’s P2P Network, an organization that builds safe and accessible tools and spaces for women to connect globally, to support and organize around key issues. We work in cross-border collaborations between technical and grassroots women (some men too!) who care about women’s empowerment. Women’s P2P Network was created by Rachel Leventhal, a human rights journalist who, for nearly three decades, has documented global women’s stories and movements.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center; padding-left:200px; padding-right:200px">
  The Electing Women Project is being built by a global team in order to help make it easier and safer for women to run for office and win, thus increasing the number of women elected globally. The goal of the project is to help women candidates overcome the common barriers they face (including safety, corruption, fundraising challenges, need for training, experiences of stigma and isolation) by creating a central repository of resources (vetted by local women’s groups) and a support network of global women candidates who face similar challenges. Truly grassroots in design, the ultimate outcome of the project will be driven by the women themselves.
